problem 1:This algorithm helps to find the sum of all distinct elements from the sets given by using array given. 
  distinctSum(array1, array2)
problem 2: This function checks if two vectors have the same dimensions and, if so, calculates their scalar product. If the product is zero, the function identifies the vectors as orthogonal and returns this classification.
     dot_product(vector1, vector2)
